A website to learn about the gruesome deaths of catholic saints.


Link to project: https://lizkil-dead-saints.herokuapp.com/

### Tech used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express

### How It's Made
I built out a simple HTML and CSS frontend where you can choose the saint's names in a dropdown menu. A server serves all of the static files like CSS and JavaScript and provides acces to the JSON-Database. You can fetch the data from the database per get-request and it's then displayed on the DOM.

### Lessons Learned:
I learned how to serve static files on a node server when the browser makes an HTTP request for them and to read files from a database. I then learned how to host an app on heroku through the heroku CLI, as well as trouble shoot any errors with the build and the upload. I learned how to dynamically change the port for my server with an environment variables or the hardcoded port if it doesn't exist. 

### Optimizations
The database needs to be expanded.

### Installation
npm install
